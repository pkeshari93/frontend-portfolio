					Hey there! I am Prakhar. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for CREATING and BUILDING simple tools that help simple people like you and I to optimize our lives and work on things that matter and move us forward. I beleieve every challenge is an opportunity to come out better and stronger and we must use every single day to hunt down these challenges and work on them to solve problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I take pride in belonging from Varanasi, India, more popularly known as Benares or Kashi. If you didn't know it is believed to be the holiest city in the world. It sits on the bank of river Ganges and as quoted by Mark Twain, "Benares is older than history, older even than legends and looks twice as old as all of them put together."

					Another Interesting fact, Buddha founded Buddhism in my hometown around 528 BCE. 
					<br><br>
					Here, Feast your eyes with a glimpse of Benares!

				<p>
					I consider myself fortunate to be an alum of Michigan Tech. It is a prestigious institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was on the 2017 Forbes list of top 25 STEM colleges in the U.S. More than a college it was my home 7 oceans away from home. Words are hard to describe the Utopia I lived in for 4.5 years. Life was crazy at Tech. being surrounded by brilliant, passionate students and faculty. Summers and falls were as colorful as a rainbow and the winters and springs were cold and blizzardy with over 200 inches of snow that we received in Houghton every year. It was hard to leave after I graduated, but I am glad to say I moved on to the next phase of my life with beautiful memories from Michigan Tech.

							<h2>Projects</h2>

					</div>
					
					<p>
						This was my first experience at developing full-stack projects on a team of Software Engineers. I believe this is where the web-application development bug caught me, and I found my true passion in this vast software industry, which is to build simple, but effective tools for simple people like you and I with a clean UI and engaging experience. These two projects were part of my Senior-Design course in the final year of my Software Engineering program at Michigan Tech. Both the applications were developed under the guidance of a Product Owner, which was our instructor and mentor. Mobile Hydrology was built in collaboration with scientists at Northern Arizona University and ACL Risk Estimator was built in collaboration with Erich Petushek (PhD, CSCS
						Assistant Professor College of Human Medicine - Marquette Campus)

										Mobile hydrology is a web application where hydrologists, scientists, students and citizens can create their own history of water in their backyard, community, stream, spring or lake and join a global community of hydrology scientists and engineers who study and manage our water resources. Mobile Hydrology uses DBSCAN image processing to read water gauges planted in the reservoir and adds the information to the database of information collected from the same gauge.

										ACL Risk Estimator is a web-application to provide means for Upper Peninsula (UP) high school (HS) coaches to get ACL injury risk assessment for their athletes and some education on prevention and mitigation of ACL injuries. Coaches or Athlete Trainers can upload videos of their athletes performing a jump, which later can be assessed by an injury expert to rate the ACL at risk on a scale of 1-10 along with feedback.

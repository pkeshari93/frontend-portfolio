					<h2>My Story</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="about-img">

				</div>
				<p>Hey there! I am Prakhar. I take pride in belonging from Varanasi, India, more popularly known as Benares or Kashi. If you didn't know it is believed to be the holiest city in the world. It sits on the bank of river Ganges and as quoted by Mar Twain, "Benares is older than history, older even than legends and looks twice as old as all of them put together."

				Another Interesting fact, Buddha founded Buddhism in my hometown around 528 BCE.

				The city itself is enormously huge with a population of 1.2 million. Lol when they say India has a population problem they are not lying. Walking through the streets you will submerged in the hustle-bustle of a growing economy, and at the same time be amazed by the history, culture and some of the most exquisite architectures such as palaces, temples, mosques, etc. built by the Hindu and Mughal Emperors that ruled the lands only until a few thousand years ago. 

				Here, Feast your eyes with a picture!

					Enough about my hometown though. Let me tell you a little about myself. I am a free-spirited human who believes in looking at the world with the perspective of an artist and a poet. I always challenge myself to do things with my whole heart as if I am creating a piece of art. I left home early at the age of 13 to continue education at boarding schools. Then moved to other parts of India for high school while preparing for entrance exams for engineering colleges in India. Believe me when I say these exams are highly competitive especially when you are fighting for the best colleges against over 5 million smart, hard-working students.

					Just so it happened, during my prep. I suffered a back injury. The next thing I knew was I had lost 2 years of my life going through a depressing phase of my life involving a back surgery to cut out my two lower-back vertebral discs. I could barely walk, that too with pain. I remember going to the hospital for my surgery in a wheel chair.  I was put on 24X7 bed rest for 3 months, with little to no movement. Had to learn to walk again with a lot of painful physio0therapy sessions. I even put on a lot of undesired weight and lost mobility in my body in general. 

					But hey! like every other story my story has a silver lining too, that to a bold one. I decided to take charge of my life and completely transformed my body and mind. Now, here we are 4.5 years later, I am a Software Engineer with a passion in fitness, health and nutrition, and I want to change the face of the fitness industry with the help of technology and help those who are going through something that I have went through or even worse. This whole episode taught me to believe in myself and the idea that I can take any challenge, turn it into an opportunity and come out stronger and better than ever before. I am proud of my transformation and want to use my story to inspire others.

				<div class="tech-logo"><img src="images/logo3.png" alt="Michigan Tech"></div>
				<p>
					I consider myself fortunate to be an alum of Michigan Tech. It is a prestigious institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was on the 2017 Forbes list of top 25 STEM colleges in the U.S. More than a college it was my home 7 oceans away from home. Words are hard to describe the Utopia I lived in for 4.5 years. Life was crazy at Tech. being surrounded by brilliant, passionate students and faculty. Summers and falls were as colorful as a rainbow and the winters and springs were cold and blizzardy with over 200 inches of snow that we received in Houghton every year. It was hard to leave after I graduated, but I am glad to say I moved on to the next phase of my life with beautiful memories from Michigan Tech.

					<p>
						This was my first experience at developing full-stack projects on a team of Software Engineers. I believe this is where the web-application development bug caught me, and I found my true passion in this vast software industry, which is to build simple, but effective tools for simple people like you and I with a clean UI and engaging experience. These two projects were part of my Senior-Design course in the final year of my Software Engineering program at Michigan Tech.
